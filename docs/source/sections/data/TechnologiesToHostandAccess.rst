Google Technologies Used to Host Data (and How to Access Them)
**************************************************************
Google has `many technologies <https://cloud.google.com/products/storage/>`_ to store your data.  ISB-CGC has chosen technologies that enable common workflows using historically used file based methods (as the TCGA data exists in the GDC), as well as in `data tools <https://cloud.google.com/products/#big-data>`_ that are well adapted to the speed and extensibility of the cloud ("Big Data").  Overviews are provided below, with links to more specific detailed documentation of how to use it at ISB-CGC.

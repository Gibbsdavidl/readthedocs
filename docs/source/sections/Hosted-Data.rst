Cloud-Hosted Data Sets

The ISB-CGC platform hosts the majority of the TCGA data set as well as other reference and 
annotation datasets in different appropriate Google Cloud technologies.  

We are actively working on hosting TARGET and CGCI datasets provided by the Genomics Data Commons, as well as images and proteomics data from the TCGA dataset.  Stay tuned for updates.
